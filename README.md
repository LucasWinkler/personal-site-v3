## About

Iteration 3 of my personal website which I built to help practice with responsiveness, accessibility and because my last website wasn't the best. It was lacking in a lot of places.

This website was fully designed by myself using Figma after I was done binge watching Design Course on YouTube. I've recently gotten back into web development and I wanted to create something that looked great and responded great with different device sizes. This project is being hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a> and I'm using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vite</a> to help make development easier.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps in order to get the website up and running locally on your machine.

### Installation

- Install all required dependencies

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Host a local development server

  ```sh

  ```

- Host a local development server that is exposed to your network

  ```

### Production
