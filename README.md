## About

Iteration 3 of my personal website which I built to help practice with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website was fully designed by myself using Figma after I was done binge watching Design Course on YouTube. I wanted to redesign my website because iteration 2 was finished in 2020 and it's very outdated. I've recently gotten back into web development and I wanted to create something that looked great and responded great with different device sizes. This project is being hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a> and I'm using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vite</a> to help make development easier.
